E-Waste:
</h3>
<p>E-waste is the term used for all waste from electronic equipment that is 
unwanted and cannot be reused.</p>
<p>Computers and other electronic equipment are made from hundreds of 
different materials. Many of these materials are hazardous and are a 
big threat if not disposed properly.</p>
<p>Heavy metals including lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic, from E-waste, 
pollute our precious land, water and even our children, 
if they end up in our landfills.</p>

<h4>So Take action to avoid your old equipment dumped in landfills</h4>
<p>E-waste is increasing very fast in New Zealand and it is much more 
toxic than normal household waste. Computers and other electronic equipment 
can contain toxic heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury. The plastic 
covers and wires inside the equipment can also contain hazardous materials, 
such as brominated flame retardants. These materials may critically pollute 
our precious land, water and even our children, if they end up in our landfills.</p>
<p>Please do not let your old equipment be sitting around your house gathering 
dust, nor it put on the streets on inorganic collection days to avoid being 
dumped in our landfills.</p>
